[Chorus]
Now it feels like I'm respected
Talk your shit now I walk 'round with the weapons

(Yuh-uh oh)

Ever since I was depressed man
Man I've been such a long way I just wonder man what is next

(C4pr-r-r-r-r)

Might as well take a break from this shit
GTA, I wasted my heart on some bitch
And this shit is plain annoying I might jump off a bridge
Yeah they looking at me like they wanna [?]

(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh no)

[Verse]
[?] lookin' at the scene just like a Go-Pro
Y-y-You talk shit on me and expect me just to go bro?
B-b-better watch out that chop, I'll make you go slow
